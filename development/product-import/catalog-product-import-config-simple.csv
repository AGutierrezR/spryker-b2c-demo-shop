Noguchi emphasized this effect with thin, but extremely comfortable upholstery padding and a choice of cover fabrics in natural colors. Produced around 1950, today the few remaining pieces achieve record prices at auction. Since 2002, the group has been produced by the Vitra Design Museum as a fully authentic re-edition.

Besides Alessi, Brinovega, Danese or Flos it belongs to the traditional, Italian design businesses. But Kartellis reckoned as a pioneer business of the plastic-furniture-production.While many manufacturers thought plastic is a cheap material, Kartell stacked to this material and made plastic as equal as all the other materials.Kartell is known since the beginning of the 1950ies with its production of houseware. Chasing power was the house designer Gino Colombini, who still serves comfortless and plain kitchen mashines like lemon juicer, garbage bins, or storing boxes in new, delicious colours and shapes.From the beginning to the middle of the 1960ies people experimented at Kartell with new production methods through which strong and tough plastic was won of which they could produce furniture. An earlier and - like it was said - first plastic chair ever, the chunky, but stackable and weatherproof children's chair ""K4999"" was designed in 1964 in cooperation with the designers Marco Zanuso and Richard Sapper. While they produced only householdware and little lamp series at Kartell, was the century of the plastic furnitureintroduced by the small ""K4999"".In the 1960ies Kartell managed in the labs the research, so that designers could design their designs with always new patent plastics. Italian Design-like Joe Colombo, Achille Castiglioni, Vico Magistretti or Anna Castelli Ferrieri designed on this basis different furniture series made of plastic, which are today classics. To this belong e.g. Joe Colombos stackable chair 4867 (1968), which is a bestseller or the stackable Container-Element 4970/84 by Anna Castelli Ferrieri (1967), which are build without any screws and other fastenings and which are still a inherent part in the programm of Kartell.",,"chair, Design, Shop, Velle, online shop, kartell, couches, couch, sofa. sofas",,,,,,,,plastic,1,Default Category|Sofas & Couches,,,

With purchases kept on a minimum, a maximum amount of books is stored in a space-saving way and clearly arranged.

Buchstabler is stabilized with a Simple, but clever technique:. a string connects the base and the top of the shelf. The tension, produced from twisting the string, holds the shelf tightly together.

Situated in the midst of the Alps, the company tries to haveeverything manufactured by firms located nearby. As a large proportionof the product components are manufactured by external suppliers, thecompany retains a high degree of flexibility and a large breadth ofitems manufactured. The regional structures, which have developed over along period of time, paired with international contacts, have adecisive influence on the company philosophy. For example, the seemingdisadvantage of a lack of infrastructure is compensated for by consciousdefinition of what the company stands for by the place where it islocated. From an unconventional one-man firm, an enterprise hasdeveloped which employs a team of 20 employees, who leave Nils HolgerMoormann time to be active as an international juror and lecturer.The furniture collection, of which many individualitems have been awarded international design prizes, is constantly beingextended, with new furniture and product lines being added all thetime.",,"cabinet, Design, Shop, Velle, online shop, moormann, cabinet",,,,,,,,wood,1,Default Category|Cabinets,,,
